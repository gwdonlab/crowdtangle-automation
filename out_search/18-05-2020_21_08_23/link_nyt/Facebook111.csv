9,Stop à la propagande anti-vacc...,"5,657 Page Likes","✒️ Auteur : Kevin Roose Préparez-vous à une guerre d'information sur les vaccins Les médias sociaux sont déjà remplis de fausses informations sur un vaccin Covid-19, des mois ou des années avant même qu'il n'existe. L'autre soir, en regardant un extrait de ""Plandemic"" - un documentaire qui s'est propagé sur les médias sociaux la semaine dernière, répandant du jour au lendemain des mensonges sans fondement et des absurdités démystifiées sur le coronavirus à des millions d'Américains - j'ai eu une pensée terrifiante : - Et si nous obtenions un vaccin Covid-19 et que la moitié du pays refusait de le prendre ? Il m'est apparu que toute la désinformation que nous avons vue jusqu'à présent - les fausses rumeurs selon lesquelles les tours de téléphonie cellulaire 5G alimentent le coronavirus, que boire de l'eau de Javel ou injecter des rayons UV peut le guérir, que le Dr Anthony Fauci fait partie d'une conspiration anti-Trump - n'est peut-être que le prélude à une guerre de l'information beaucoup plus vaste lorsqu'un vaccin efficace sera mis à la disposition du public. Cette guerre pourrait opposer les responsables de la santé publique et les politiciens à un mouvement anti-vaccination qui inonde les médias sociaux de désinformation, de théories conspirationnistes et de propagande visant à convaincre les gens que le vaccin est une menace plutôt qu'un bienfait permettant de sauver des vies et l'économie. Le plus effrayant de tout ? cela pourrait, en fait, fonctionner. J'ai suivi la communauté anti-vaccins, de près et de loin, pendant des années, en observant ses membres opérer dans des groupes privés sur Facebook et des comptes Instagram, et j'ai découvert qu'ils sont beaucoup plus organisés et stratégiques que ne le croient nombre de leurs détracteurs. Ce sont des manipulateurs, de médias, avisés, des communicateurs efficaces et expérimentés dans l'exploitation des faiblesses des plateformes de médias sociaux. (Juste un exemple : Peu après que Facebook et YouTube ont commencé à retirer des copies de ""Plandemic"" pour avoir violé leurs règles, j'ai vu des gens dans des groupes anti-vaccins l'éditer de manière subtile pour échapper au logiciel d'application automatique des plateformes et le rediffuser). En bref, les anti-vaccins se sont entraînés pour cette guerre. Et je crains qu'ils ne soient exceptionnellement efficaces pour semer le doute sur un vaccin Covid-19, et ce, pour plusieurs raisons. Premièrement, en raison de l'urgence de la pandémie, tout vaccin Covid-19 prometteur sera probablement soumis à un processus d'essai et d'approbation accéléré. Il pourrait ne pas passer par des années d'essais cliniques et d'études approfondies des éventuels effets secondaires à long terme, comme c'est le cas pour d'autres médicaments. Cela pourrait permettre aux militants anti-vaccins de prétendre que le vaccin n'a pas été testé et qu'il est dangereux, et de transformer des inquiétudes raisonnables, au sujet du vaccin, en craintes généralisées et infondées quant à sa sécurité. Deuxièmement, si un vaccin apparaît, il y a de fortes chances que des organisations de santé de premier plan comme la Fondation Bill et Melinda Gates ou l'Organisation mondiale de la santé participent à sa production ou à sa distribution. Si tel est le cas, les militants anti-vaccins, qui mènent une croisade contre ces organisations, depuis des années, disposeront d'un stock important d'arguments pour tenter de les discréditer. Ils s'en prennent déjà à Bill Gates avec des théories complotistes, sans fondement, prétendant qu'il a créé le virus et qu'il essaie d'en tirer profit. Ces théories seront amplifiées, et les tentatives de discréditer les efforts de recherche de pointe sur le virus s'intensifieront à mesure que le vaccin se rapprochera. Troisièmement, si, et quand, un vaccin Covid-19 sera approuvé pour une utilisation généralisée, les gens pourront être obligés de le prendre avant d'être autorisés à prendre l'avion sur certaines compagnies aériennes, à fréquenter certaines écoles ou à entrer dans certaines entreprises. C'est une bonne idée, du point de vue de la santé publique, mais cela pourrait alimenter certaines des pires craintes du mouvement anti-vaccin. La vaccination obligatoire a été un sujet de discussion particulièrement important pour les militants anti-vaccins, dont certains se sont présentés comme ""pro-choix"" en matière de vaccins. Des années de lutte entre les États et les districts scolaires au sujet des politiques de vaccination obligatoire leur ont permis de créer un enchevêtrement d'obstacles juridiques et de campagnes publicitaires préjudiciables. Je voulais savoir si mes craintes concernant une guerre de l'information sur les vaccins étaient fondées, et j'ai donc contacté Neil Johnson et Rhys Leahy, deux chercheurs de l'université George Washington.

72,Utah Democratic Health Care Ca...,770 Members,"THIS IS THE UGLY: **Get Ready for the Global Fight Over Vaccines** *This isn’t just about saving lives. It’s also about power, profit and national prestige.* All the world agrees: We need a [vaccine for the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-disinformation.html). But as soon as we get one, it’s going to open up a geopolitical can of worms. Despite the [commitment of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/TheOptimist/coronavirus), international demand will outstrip initial supply. What then? How to avoid a repeat of the pushing and shoving that have characterized the global scramble for personal protective equipment and diagnostic tests? Rich countries will compete for priority access to whichever vaccine first makes its way to market. Poor countries, at the back of the queue, will have to wait until the vaccine receives “[prequalification](https://www.who.int/medicines/regulation/prequalification/prequal-vaccines/about/en/)” from the World Health Organization and is then distributed by aid organizations. There are [more than 25 million refugees](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/global-refugee-crisis-statistics-and-facts/) in the world, 80 percent of them hosted by developing countries. They are least likely to be factored into any government’s vaccine order and the least likely to be vaccinated. In turn, their populations could become hotbeds of epidemic resurgence, which would not only keep the disease in circulation but would also most likely stigmatize them further. This is not the preface to an anti-vaccination tirade. Vaccines have saved millions of lives. They are an essential tool of public health. But have we been led to expect too much of them? Have we invested too much of our hopes — and our resources — in them at the expense of other public health measures? Our modern faith in the power of vaccines was cemented in the 1970s. At the time, global public health officials wanted to strengthen international commitment to fighting disease and improving health around the world. At an ambitious and influential conference in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in 1978, health leaders from around the world [issued a declaration stating](https://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf) that socio-economic development was vital for health and that health care had to be integrated with goals like clean drinking water and safe working conditions. The Almaty conference had been planned to tread cautiously amid Cold War rivalries, but power politics ended up deciding the trajectory of what followed. Critics of the declaration — many of them from the United States — argued that its goals were unrealistic and unaffordable. Instead, they said, the emphasis should be on tackling specific diseases for which effective technologies of prevention or control existed — like vaccines. The critics prevailed. Without doubt, a safe and effective vaccine has a vital role to play in preventing or controlling a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic. But as the Alma Ata Declaration shows, vaccines and international politics have always been tied together. And this time will be no different. In fact, in the face of a pandemic that has decimated economies, disrupted lives and shaken politics, the political battle will probably be fiercer than ever. Some of the more than 100 candidate vaccines are already entering human trials. They are being developed by Chinese companies such as CanSino Bio and by American companies such as Moderna and Inovio. Each has financial support from its national government. Pfizer is collaborating with a German biotech company, BioNTech. The American government is also supporting a collaboration between GSK and Sanofi, two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, while researchers at Oxford University are collaborating with the Serum Institute of India, a private company. Many of these investigations are supported by the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, itself funded by a number of governmental and nongovernmental donors. It is impossible to know who will win this race. A great deal is at stake. In addition to saving lives, this is also about power, profit and national prestige.Developing a new vaccine costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Pharmaceutical companies are tight-lipped when it comes to disclosing profits, though according to one estimate, production of HPV vaccines quickly yielded a return of more than five times investment. More certain is that the rapidly growing vaccine market has become the pharmaceutical industry’s major source of growth.Since many candidate vaccines are being developed by transnational collaborations, it is hard to know whether any country will be able to employ a vaccine to political ends as China has done with ventilator production.

They are savvy media manipulators, effective communicators and experienced at exploiting the weaknesses of social media platforms. In short, the anti-vaxxers have been practicing for this. And I’m worried that they will be unusually effective in sowing doubts about a Covid-19 vaccine for several reasons. First, because of the pandemic’s urgency, any promising Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be fast-tracked through the testing and approval process. It may not go through years of clinical trials and careful studies of possible long-term side effects, the way other drugs do. That could create an opening for anti-vaccine activists to claim that it is untested and dangerous, and to spin reasonable concerns about the vaccine into widespread, unfounded fears about its safety. Second, if a vaccine does emerge, there is a good chance that leading health organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the World Health Organization will have a hand in producing or distributing it. If that’s the case, anti-vaccine activists, who have been crusading against these groups for years, will have plenty of material stockpiled to try to discredit them.","May 14, 2020",0,https://www.facebook.com/NorthCountryMatters/posts/4057810704236700
