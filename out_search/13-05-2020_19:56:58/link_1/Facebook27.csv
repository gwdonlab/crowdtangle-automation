But this convergence of estimates — 31,000 to 42,000 additional deaths through mid-June for roughly 120,000 total deaths in the United States — comes just as shifts in public policy are likely to create new uncertainty about the path of the pandemic after that. [As Some Countries Ease Up, Others are Reimposing Lockdowns Amid a Resurgence of Coronavirus Infections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/as-some-countries-ease-up-others-are-reimposing-lockdowns-amid-a-resurgence-of-coronavirus-infections/2020/05/12/6373cf6a-9455-11ea-87a3-22d324235636_story.html) *(The Washington Post)* As many parts of the world, including the United States, explore ways to ease restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus, countries that had already opened up are closing down again after renewed spikes in infections. *Science & Technology* [Get Ready for a Vaccine Information War ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/technology/coronavirus-vaccine-disinformation.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) *(The New York Times)* Social media is already filling up with misinformation about a Covid-19 vaccine, months or years before one even exists. [Artificial Intelligence Systems Aim to Sniff Out Signs of COVID-19 Outbreak ](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/artificial-intelligence-systems-aim-sniff-out-signs-covid-19-outbreaks) *(Science)* The international alarm about the COVID-19 pandemic was sounded first not by a human, but by a computer. HealthMap, a website run by Boston Children’s Hospital, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to scan social media, news reports, internet search queries, and other information streams for signs of disease outbreaks. [Scientists: ‘Exactly Zero’ Evidence COVID-19 Came From a Lab ](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/05/scientists-exactly-zero-evidence-covid-19-came-lab) *(CIDRAP) * While Andersen, like other prominent virologists, says that he can't completely rule out the possibility that the virus came from a lab, the odds of that happening are very small. He says the new coronavirus clearly originated in nature, ""no question about it by now."" [Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine Moves to Phase 2 Testing and Gets Fast-Track Approval from the U.S. Government](https://time.com/5835785/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-phase-2/) *(Time)* On May 12, Moderna Therapeutics, based in Cambridge, Mass., received fast-track approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273. Days earlier, the FDA gave the company the green light to proceed to Phase 2 testing of the vaccine, which is expected to begin shortly. [Coronavirus Drugs Trials Must Get Bigger and More Collaborative ](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01391-9) *(Nature)* Researchers have rallied in unprecedented ways to defeat the coronavirus pandemic. They are retooling laboratories to focus on the virus; helping with testing efforts; and, in the case of clinician–researchers, working feverishly to carry out research studies while also treating patients in overwhelmed health-care systems. **Public & Global Health** [The Cost of Inaction: COVID-19 Related Service Disruptions Could Cause Hundreds of Thousands of Extra Deaths from HIV ](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/11-05-2020-the-cost-of-inaction-covid-19-related-service-disruptions-could-cause-hundreds-of-thousands-of-extra-deaths-from-hiv) *(WHO)* A modelling group convened by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS has estimated that if efforts are not made to mitigate and overcome interruptions in health services and supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic, a six-month disruption of antiretroviral therapy could lead to more than 500 000 extra deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, including from tuberculosis, in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020–2021. **Domestic Preparedness & Response** [Gilead Sciences Donates More than 600K Vials of Remdesivir for Hospital Use](https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/48983-gilead-sciences-donates-more-than-600k-vials-of-remdesivir-for-hospital-use/) (truncated)","May 13, 2020",0
